## Brief Bio
Hi! I’m Rashmi Priya Sharma a Senior Research Fellow at the Indian Institute of Technology, Dhanbad in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. 
I am also Senior Data Scientist in a startup. Being a climate activist my research are all grounded in the idea that science and technology can help us to overcome Climate crises. I have expertise in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Big Data Processings. For a decade I have been investigating the applications of ICT technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, IoT and the digital twin in mitigating the impact of climate change on agriculture, water resources and human health.



## Research Interests
I broadly work in Big data analytics and its application in the field of [precision agriculture](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/precision-agriculture), that is, analyzing the data and building models to ensure that crops and soil receive exactly what they need for optimum health and productivity. The problems that are addressed in my research work so far are:-
 - Crop recommendation system, using the Naive Bayes algorithm, to find the best time of sowing and ideal crop for plantation based on environmental parameters and predict the expected harvest.
 - Adaboost.RT-based N-P-K prediction to decide required soil NPK content using one-time soil testing like accessible soil contents, type of soil, crop, and yield target. 
 - Discussing the core concept of Machine learning and systematic processes to comprehend its application in agriculture. 
 - An efficient DBSCAN based model to find and treat the cotton plant affected by Xanthomonas mavacearum and identify the soil areas affected by an overuse of the pesticides. 
 - Modular artificial neural network-based crop yield prediction by considering weather attributes and land and suggesting measures to increase the crop yield. .
