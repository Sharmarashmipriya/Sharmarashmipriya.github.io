### **IoT enabled WSN monitoring infrastructure driven Fuzzy-logic based Crop pest prediction**
<p align="justify"> <img align="right" src="/images/proj2.png" width="370">
Precision Agriculture, as the future of farming technology, addresses challenges faced by farmers by data-mining of information collected through IoT-enabled crop monitoring infrastructures. The identification of Crop disease is one of the widely studied challenges. Crop diseases cannot be accurately predicted by merely analyzing individual disease causes. This work presents a Fuzzy logic-based pest prediction mechanism assisting in beforehand preparedness for potential pest prevention. The experiments are performed for pests in rice and millet crops. The Data-mining over samples collected in a cropping cycle revealed the plausible correlation between temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall with pest breeding. The data collected through IoT monitoring infrastructure is analyzed for the ambient breeding condition of the pest.

These conditions are then employed to design the knowledge base of the fuzzy system. More specifically, the linguistic variables of the fuzzy membership function are optimized using a genetic algorithm for close prediction of pest breeding in given environmental conditions. The work verified that the weather factors have a strong impact on the occurrence of pests and diseases, and the fuzzy logic-based pest predication through IoT application development services will help farmers to take precautionary measures beforehand.
Despite using chemical pesticides and various non-chemical methods like crop rotation and genetic improvement of the crop, more than 40% of the total food produced is destroyed every year by weeds, molds, and other pests. As the world’s population has grown significantly and will continue to grow, by the middle of this century, it is estimated that the world will require more than 70% of its food. The use of pesticides and fungicides not only generates high costs for farmers but also pollutes the environment. The productivity and profitability of crops are reduced by all types of pathogens like insects, weeds, fungi, viruses, and mites. Therefore, usage should be reduced. In short, looking at the productivity and quality of crops, pollution, and pesticide costs, we can understand the importance of IoT Predictive Systems. Various works in the literature show the correlation between crop growth stages, weather conditions, and pest growing conditions. Despite the association between these three entities, there is no doubt that climate is a vital factor that operates between pests and crops. It is possible to develop a prediction system only after understanding this relationship to reduce pest growth. Various studies have reported that meteorological factors like rainfall, temperature, humidity, condensation, and precipitation have a direct influence on the pests growing conditions. Some analysis also states temperature and rainfall as significant factors for pest growth. For example, the growth of certain pests increases when the climate is hot and humid. It has also been observed that an increase in rainfall also helps in the spread of plant diseases. Hence, there is a need to monitoring meteorological data such as rain, moisture, and condensation to take beforehand preventive measures for the possible occurrence of the pest and frequency of pesticide and fungicide use.

### **Crop Plantation Correctness Index Identification**

There is a change in the climate in the past few decades. Various recent surveys and studies show the change in climatic conditions and this includes changes in the rainfall pattern, fluctuation in temperature, shifts in the timing of the season. As agriculture is dependent upon climate, the adverse effect of climate can be seen in agriculture; therefore, it is highly recommended to manage the resources according to the season shift for maximizing the crop yield.

The weather directly influences agriculture, starting from the sowing of the seed to the harvest of the crop. Hence, well-planned and well-scheduled planting date is a must requirement for higher productivity; this will help efficient utilization of resources like water for irrigation, fertilizers, and pesticides and increase the farmers’ profit. At present, farmers generally follow a fixed planting schedule, which they are practicing for years. As there is a shift in the climatic conditions, a planting schedule based on the previous knowledge can lead to a decline in production, loss in labor cost, depletion of soil fertility, etc. The simplest way to face this challenge is to change the planting schedule. Considering the past year’s data and knowing the amount of climate shift can help in preparing a cropping schedule. Various studies also support the importance of selecting a correct planting date, which also helps in proper water management.

### **ML based sustainable precision agriculture:**
<p align="justify"> <img align="right" src="/images/proj1.png" width="370">
At the end of July 1966 an interdisciplinary meeting was held at the University of Reading, to discuss the relationships between climate and agriculture. This symposium was attended by scientists from thirty-six countries, sponsored by U, and organized by Professor A. H. Bunting, professor of agricultural botany at Reading, and Mr. L.P. Smith, president of the Commission for Agricultural Meteorology of the World Meteorological Organization. The conclusions reached at the symposium was that the demand for the correct assessment of climatic factors when planning for the increased food production which is so urgently needed by an expanding world population has become a matter of prime importance to both United Nations technical agencies and individual countries.

Time is short, and if the fundamental scientific knowledge is as yet so incomplete that it cannot point immediately to the best solution to any specific problem, at the very least it should be adequate to avoid errors. The cost of the mis-use of land is no longer measured in terms of money, but in human lives. The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a highly promising family of technologies which is capable of offering many solutions towards the modernization of agriculture. Scientific groups and research institutions, as well as the industry, are in a race trying to deliver more and more IoT products to the agricultural business stakeholders, and, eventually, lay the foundations to have a clear role when IoT becomes a mainstream technology. At the same time Cloud Computing, which is already very popular, and Fog Computing provide sufficient resources and solutions to sustain, store and analyses the huge amounts of data generated by IoT devices. The management and analysis of IoT data (“Big Data”) can be used to automate processes, predict situations and improve many activities, even in real-time. Moreover, the concept of interoperability among heterogeneous devices inspired the creation of the appropriate tools, with which new applications and services can be created and give an added value to the data flows produced at the edge of the network. The agricultural sector was highly affected by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies and is expected to be equally benefited by the IoT.
