     When it comes to Social Media Marketing for their businesses,
     many people feel dissatisfied, overwhelmed, or that they are
     missing out. At KnoxMedia we help companies build their brand
     and sell more stuff through ENGAGING Social Media Marketing.
   </p>
   <p>
     The human brain pays attention to information that helps it
     survive and thrive. If your content on Social Media and
     beyond doesn't provide your audience that value, you've
     become white noise.
   </p>
       <div class="read-more-target">
     <p>
       Because businesses are so close to their products and
       services, it can be especially challenging to create
       content that your audience understands and wants to engage
       with.
     </p>
     <p>
       If that wasn’t difficult enough, there is also the rapidly
       changing digital landscape of algorithms, updates, and
       progressively shorter attention spans. Business leaders:
       don't be dismayed because we care about your business and
       want to help you enjoy consistent, predictable, and
       scalable growth.
     </p>
     <p>
       Unlike hiring a team in-house, we must habitually help you
       build your brand and sell more stuff so that we keep you as
       a client at the end of each short term agreement. We've got
       all the best content creators, designers, marketers, and
       social media experts in place which enable you to scale

       your friends. If you're a Medium or Large business, you'll
       be able to lower your fixed overhead and improve your
       marketing ROI.
     </p>
     <p>
       Be wary of having the wrong people producing your content
       as it may be damaging to your brand and wasting precious
       marketing resources. Your competition loves finding you
       under those circumstances.
     </p>
     <p>
       What makes us uniquely different is that we are one of the
       few agencies who let you, metaphorically, go on a date with
       us before any long-term commitment. We call it our "Love it
       or Leave us Guarantee." It's up to you do decide after the
       first month if we're a good fit for a short 6-month
       commitment.

## Current Research in Progress

### **Low cost fringing field capacitive soil moisture sensor design**
<p align="justify"> <img align="right" src="/images/soil.png" width="430">
Efficient irrigation management techniques ensure a long-term food supply under optimum ecological, economic, and social conditions. The most dominating factor influencing irrigation management decisions is Soil Water Content (SWC). The SWC measurements may vary at different depths in different locations for the same flow of water during irrigation as the water movement is different for different soil compositions. Mathematical models of soil water movement often use unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (UHC) as a driving factor. The UHC depends on pore-size distribution, tortuosity, pore connectivity and groundwater table. The UHC is a soil-specific parameter, and its manual measurement in the field is difficult and time-consuming. 
 <details><summary markdown="span">Read More</summary>
  
More advanced SWC and UHC measurement methods use approaches based on neutron scattering, thermogravimetric and dielectric techniques. These methods require the measuring probe to be deployed at multiple soil depths to capture the SWC profile. The Capacitive Moisture Measurement (CMM) method is the most widely adopted technique due to its reliable and low cost implementation. However, the overall cost and energy consumption of an IoT enabled Wireless Sensor Network (IoWSN) employing these sensors can be much higher if deployment is to be done on large farms with multi depth sensing. In this work, with the aim of reducing the cost and energy usage of IoWSN deployment, we have developed a Neural Network (NN) based single probe imitation of a multi-depth capacitive soil moisture sensor.</details></p>

### **2.4Ghz signal characterization in food grass crop**
<p align="justify">The United Nations predicts that by the end of this century, the world population will increase from 7.7 billion in 2019 to 11.2 billion, affecting food security and leading to civil unrest. Precision farming is the need of the hour that helps farmers increase crop production using Information and Communications Technologies (ICT). The most prominent ICT technology over the decade is artificial intelligence based mining of data collected though IoT assisted Wireless Sensor Network (IoWSN) based monitoring infrastructure. The IoWSN in the precision agriculture paradigm is a sustainable, economic, and eco-friendly in-situ data collection approach. Zigbee, LoRa, NB-IoT and Sigfox are the most widely adopted sensor communication technologies for IoWSN development which can interconnect thousands of wireless devices or nodes through Mesh networking. A Node Deployment Strategy (NDS) in IoWSN aims to deploy sensors with varying distances, heights and orientations so that each location in the target farm is covered and all nodes have K-connectivity. --more-- Target crop vegetation elevation and density at maturity stage can cause signal attenuation between two communicating nodes. For this reason, conducted IoWSN based experiments employing tree-based and Free Space Path Loss based (FSPL) NDS approaches for 2.4 GHz RF Zigbee node. Hence, path loss due to varying vegetation density should be considered during NDS formulation for node deployment in arable land before sowing. In the literature, NDS employed for farm monitoring adopts either the Free Space Path Loss (FSPL) model or PLM derived for tree vegetation. The authors ignore the fact that when employed in grass vegetation scenarios, the network will not be able to withstand increased signal attenuation due to vegetation growth in a cropping cycle. In this work we have attempting to perform an in-depth characterization of 2.4 GHz RF signal in food grass vegetation and trying to develop an optimized NDS approach for reliable and energy efficient IoWSN coverage. </p>

### **Role of AI & ML in mitigating the impact of climate change on farming in developing countries**
<p align="justify">At the end of July 1966 an interdisciplinary meeting was held at the University of Reading, to discuss the relationships between climate and agriculture. This symposium was attended by scientists from thirty-six countries, sponsored by U, and organized by Professor A. H. Bunting, professor of agricultural botany at Reading, and Mr. L.P. Smith, president of the Commission for Agricultural Meteorology of the World Meteorological Organization. The conclusions reached at the symposium was that the demand for the correct assessment of climatic factors when planning for the increased food production which is so urgently needed by an expanding world population has become a matter of prime importance to both United Nations technical agencies and individual countries. Time is short, and if the fundamental scientific knowledge is as yet so incomplete that it cannot point immediately to the best solution to any specific problem, at the very least it should be adequate to avoid errors. The cost of the mis-use of land is no longer measured in terms of money, but in human lives. The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a highly promising family of technologies which is capable of offering many solutions towards the modernization of agriculture. Scientific groups and research institutions, as well as the industry, are in a race trying to deliver more and more IoT products to the agricultural business stakeholders, and, eventually, lay the foundations to have a clear role when IoT becomes a mainstream technology. At the same time Cloud Computing, which is already very popular, and Fog Computing provide sufficient resources and solutions to sustain, store and analyses the huge amounts of data generated by IoT devices. The management and analysis of IoT data (“Big Data”) can be used to automate processes, predict situations and improve many activities, even in real-time. Moreover, the concept of interoperability among heterogeneous devices inspired the creation of the appropriate tools, with which new applications and services can be created and give an added value to the data flows produced at the edge of the network. The agricultural sector was highly affected by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies and is expected to be equally benefited by the IoT. </p>
