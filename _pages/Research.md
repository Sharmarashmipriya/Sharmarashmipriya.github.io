### **IoT enabled WSN monitoring infrastructure driven Fuzzy-logic based Crop pest prediction**
<p align="justify"> <img align="right" src="/images/soil1.png" width="370">
Precision Agriculture, as the future of farming technology, addresses challenges faced by farmers by data-mining of information collected through IoT-enabled crop monitoring infrastructures. The identification of Crop disease is one of the widely studied challenges. Crop diseases cannot be accurately predicted by merely analyzing individual disease causes. This work presents a Fuzzy logic-based pest prediction mechanism assisting in beforehand preparedness for potential pest prevention. The experiments are performed for pests in rice and millet crops. The Data-mining over samples collected in a cropping cycle revealed the plausible correlation between temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall with pest breeding. The data collected through IoT monitoring infrastructure is analyzed for the ambient breeding condition of the pest. These conditions are then employed to design the knowledge base of the fuzzy system. More specifically, the linguistic variables of the fuzzy membership function are optimized using a genetic algorithm for close prediction of pest breeding in given environmental conditions. The work verified that the weather factors have a strong impact on the occurrence of pests and diseases, and the fuzzy logic-based pest predication through IoT application development services will help farmers to take precautionary measures beforehand.

Despite using chemical pesticides and various non-chemical methods like crop rotation and genetic improvement of the crop, more than 40% of the total food produced is destroyed every year by weeds, molds, and other pests. As the world’s population has grown significantly and will continue to grow, by the middle of this century, it is estimated that the world will require more than 70% of its food [9]. The use of pesticides and fungicides not only generates high costs for farmers but also pollutes the environment. The productivity and profitability of crops are reduced by all types of pathogens like insects, weeds, fungi, viruses, and mites. Therefore, usage should be reduced. In short, looking at the productivity and quality of crops, pollution, and pesticide costs, we can understand the importance of IoT Predictive Systems. Various works in the literature show the correlation between crop growth stages, weather conditions, and pest growing conditions. Despite the association between these three entities, there is no doubt that climate is a vital factor that operates between pests and crops. It is possible to develop a prediction system only after understanding this relationship to reduce pest growth. Various studies have reported that meteorological factors like rainfall, temperature, humidity, condensation, and precipitation have a direct influence on the pests growing conditions. Some analysis also states temperature and rainfall as significant factors for pest growth. For example, the growth of certain pests increases when the climate is hot and humid. It has also been observed that an increase in rainfall also helps in the spread of plant diseases. Hence, there is a need to monitoring meteorological data such as rain, moisture, and condensation to take beforehand preventive measures for the possible occurrence of the pest and frequency of pesticide and fungicide use.

The United Nations predicts that by the end of this century, the world population will increase from 7.7 billion in 2019 to 11.2 billion, affecting food security and leading to civil unrest. Precision farming is the need of the hour that helps farmers increase crop production using Information and Communications Technologies (ICT). The most prominent ICT technology over the decade is artificial intelligence based mining of data collected though IoT assisted Wireless Sensor Network (IoWSN) based monitoring infrastructure.

The IoWSN in the precision agriculture paradigm is a sustainable, economic, and eco-friendly in-situ data collection approach. Zigbee, LoRa, NB-IoT and Sigfox are the most widely adopted sensor communication technologies for IoWSN development which can interconnect thousands of wireless devices or nodes through Mesh networking. A Node Deployment Strategy (NDS) in IoWSN aims to deploy sensors with varying distances, heights and orientations so that each location in the target farm is covered and all nodes have K-connectivity. Target crop vegetation elevation and density at maturity stage can cause signal attenuation between two communicating nodes. For this reason, conducted IoWSN based experiments employing tree-based and Free Space Path Loss based (FSPL) NDS approaches for 2.4 GHz RF Zigbee node. Hence, path loss due to varying vegetation density should be considered during NDS formulation for node deployment in arable land before sowing. In the literature, NDS employed for farm monitoring adopts either the Free Space Path Loss (FSPL) model or PLM derived for tree vegetation. The authors ignore the fact that when employed in grass vegetation scenarios, the network will not be able to withstand increased signal attenuation due to vegetation growth in a cropping cycle. In this work we have attempting to perform an in-depth characterization of 2.4 GHz RF signal in food grass vegetation and trying to develop an optimized NDS approach for reliable and energy efficient IoWSN coverage.

### **Role of AI & ML in mitigating the impact of climate change on farming in developing countries**

At the end of July 1966 an interdisciplinary meeting was held at the University of Reading, to discuss the relationships between climate and agriculture. This symposium was attended by scientists from thirty-six countries, sponsored by U, and organized by Professor A. H. Bunting, professor of agricultural botany at Reading, and Mr. L.P. Smith, president of the Commission for Agricultural Meteorology of the World Meteorological Organization. The conclusions reached at the symposium was that the demand for the correct assessment of climatic factors when planning for the increased food production which is so urgently needed by an expanding world population has become a matter of prime importance to both United Nations technical agencies and individual countries.

Time is short, and if the fundamental scientific knowledge is as yet so incomplete that it cannot point immediately to the best solution to any specific problem, at the very least it should be adequate to avoid errors. The cost of the mis-use of land is no longer measured in terms of money, but in human lives. The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a highly promising family of technologies which is capable of offering many solutions towards the modernization of agriculture. Scientific groups and research institutions, as well as the industry, are in a race trying to deliver more and more IoT products to the agricultural business stakeholders, and, eventually, lay the foundations to have a clear role when IoT becomes a mainstream technology. At the same time Cloud Computing, which is already very popular, and Fog Computing provide sufficient resources and solutions to sustain, store and analyses the huge amounts of data generated by IoT devices. The management and analysis of IoT data (“Big Data”) can be used to automate processes, predict situations and improve many activities, even in real-time. Moreover, the concept of interoperability among heterogeneous devices inspired the creation of the appropriate tools, with which new applications and services can be created and give an added value to the data flows produced at the edge of the network. The agricultural sector was highly affected by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies and is expected to be equally benefited by the IoT.
